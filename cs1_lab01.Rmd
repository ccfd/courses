## 1.
Create and execute the following program:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>          // header for standard input/output

int main()                  // definition of the main function
{                           // main function starting bracket
  printf("Hello!\n");
  return 0;
}                           // main function ending bracket
```
Declare two integer variables (a and b) and print results of: sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.
The results should be printed in a single line.

## 2.
Write a program which reads from the keyboard two numbers of double type and prints results of the following operations: multiplication, division, square root, cube root, fourth power, sine and cosine.
Print information on what kind of input is expected before the program starts waiting for the input:
```c++
printf("Input the first number:\n");
scanf("%lf", &a);
```
For example, the printout should be formated as follows:
```
First number    : 12.4
Second number   : 32.22
Multiplication  : 399.5
Division        : 3.85e-001
Square roots    : |3.52| |5.68|
Cube roots      : 2.314589 3.182061
Fourth powers   : 23642 1077711
```
Hint: use tabulator.

## 3.
Write a program which reads from a keyboard coordinates of three arbitrary points in 2D.
Calculate distances between those points.
Calculate also an area and a perimeter of a triangle defined by these points.
Use Heron formula $P = \sqrt{s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)}$, where $s= \frac{1}{2} (a + b + c )$, and $a$, $b$, $c$ are the lengths of the triangle sides.
Format a printout of the results in a clear and readable way.

## 4.
Modify the program from the previous point by adding code calculating angles of the triangle according to the following formulas:
$$
\tan\left(\frac{\gamma}{2} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{(p-a)(p-b)}{p(p-c)}}, \quad
\tan\left(\frac{\beta}{2} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{(p-a)(p-c)}{p(p-b)}},
\quad
\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{(p-b)(p-c)}{p(p-a)}},
$$
Print the angles in degrees with precision to three decimal places.
Check also if the calculated angles fulfill the condition: $\pi = \alpha + \beta + \gamma$.
The number $\pi$ should be defined using a preprocessor command:
```c++
#define PI (4.*atan(1))
```
(remember not to use a semicolon at the end of the preprocessor commands).
Do you know what exactly this command means?
If the condition is not satisfied print the error.

## 5.
Execute the following code:
```c++
double a, b;
double w1 = a*a – b*b;
double w2 = (a + b)*(a – b);
printf("w1 = %lf, w2 = %lf\n", w1, w2);
```
This time you can assign values to the variables $a$ and $b$ directly inside the code.
Run the program for following values:
```
100000    and 100001;
1000000   and 1000001;
10000000  and 10000001;
100000000 and 100000001;
```
What are the analytical results?
Can you continue to increase the input values ad infinity?
Repeat the same calculations for floats.
Can you explain the results?

## 6. (optional)
Modify the definition of the $\pi$:
```c++
#define PIa 4.*atan(1) // without brackets
#define PIb 4*atan(1)  // without a dot after 4
```
Compare results of the following operation for all three definitions of $\pi$:
```c++
printf("%lf\n", 3 / PI);
printf("%lf\n", 3 / PIa);
printf("%lf\n", 3 / PIb);
```
Which results are correct?
What is a reason for the errors?
