# Lab II

[Started project](http://ccfd.github.io/courses/code/hpc/lab2_starter_code.zip)

## Warmup -- conditional sum
Create a vector of random floating point numbers from the interval \[-pi, pi\].
Compute the sum of the numbers whose sine is larger than 0.5.
Measure the throughput of your approach and pass the vector size as an argument to your benchmark.
Now sort the values before computing the sum.
How does this impact execution time?
Create 2 benchmarks -- one which includes the sort in the measurement, and one which doesn't.

When is sorting a viable strategy?

## Goto algorithm
Implement the Goto algorithm.
Take advantage of the provided started code, so that you can use existing functions for allocation, initialization, etc.
Consult the lecture notes and the instructors if you have any questions.
You may use [this diagram](http://ccfd.github.io/courses/figures/hpc/Goto_gemm.png) as a reference.
